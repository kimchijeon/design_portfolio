Oh, hi there!
==========================

Welcome to my humble part of the great interwebs! 

My name is Jenny and this is my portfolio with which I aim to improve my skills in web design.

I am 27 years old, born in Malmö, Sweden but currently residing in Uppsala. I have an academic background in history and museum studies, and I have worked several years as a museum professional. I am currently a part-time student in web programming at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola.

I hope you enjoy your stay!
