About
==========================
This portfolio was started in the Fall semester of 2020 as part of the module <a href="https://dbwebb.se/kurser/design-v3">"Teknisk webbdesign och användbarhet"</a> (Technical web design and usability), which is part of the web programming course at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola.

The aim of this portfolio is to demonstrate various web design tools, techniques and principles.

This portfolio has been built using Pico and Markdown. It has to a great extent been styled using SASS, including features such as variables, nesting and operations. Modules such as normalize.css have also been used. Fonts have been imported using Google Fonts and icons from Font Awesome.

Effort has been put into good style structuring according to [SMACCS](http://smacss.com/) and creating good readability based on various principles of typography, such as optimal line spacing and height.
