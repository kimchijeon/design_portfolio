Project Website Design Principles Analysis
=======================

This analysis aims to evaluate the use of design principles and elements on my own website made for the project assignment of this module. It will be based on the same premises and structure as the [design principles analysis](%base_url%/analysis/03_design_principles) made for Kmom06. 

The aim will be to determine which design principles are implemented, what feelings they generate and whether they suit the purpose of the website.

Sample
-----------------------
The subject of this analysis is the website that I have created for the project, which is a [personal website for a fictitious web developer and designer called Bew Gorp](http://www.student.bth.se/~jeph20/dbwebb-kurser/design/me/kmom10/).

Method
-----------------------
To reach the goal of this analysis I will answer the following questions:

1. What is the purpose of the website?
2. What are the main characteristics of the website?
3. Does the design serve the purpose of the website? What feelings does the design create?
4. Which design elements and principles can be identified on the website?
5. Are the design principles implemented equally across the website's different pages?

When I created the website I based my choices of design principles on [Canva's article about "Design elements and Principles"](https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/) by Mary Stribley. The design principles will therefore be analysed in relation to this article.

Results
-----------------------

### The Purpose of the Website

[![Screenshot of my project website's "Bew Gorp" home page, 2021-01-07](%base_url%/image/bewgorp/homepage_screenshot_210107.png?w=857){.screenshot}](%base_url%/image/bewgorp/homepage_screenshot_210107.png "Click for full size")

The purpose of the website is to showcase Bew Gorp's previous work, giving potential clients a glimpse of how Gorp works and inspire them to a collaboration.

The emphasis of the professional side of Bew Gorp, as opposed to the personal one, is indicated by the navigation bar where "Projects" is deliberately put in front of any other page (except for the home page). Furthermore, the about page is about Gorp's aspirations and approach towards web development and design, and doesn't contain any personal details.

### Main Characteristics of the Website

The most prominent feature of the website is the dark space theme. The background image of rotating lights on the home page, together with the "robotic" heading font, helps to reinforce this feeling right when you enter the website.

There is also a minimalistic touch to the website where the content has been stripped to its essential parts, thus creating a lot of white (or in this case, dark) space and minimum clutter.

As you progress through the website you will also find the eye-catching recurrance of circles.

### Feelings Created by the Design

The space theme of the website is meant to inspire innovation, forward thinking and newness. The dark color palette creates a sense of endlessness but also neatness and professionality. The circles inspire you to think differently about how content could be presented. 

Seeing how the purpose of the website is to showcase Gorp's work and inspire new clients, I feel that the design does serve that purpose.

### Design Elements and Principles

The main design principles used on the website are color, grids, hierarchy and balance.

The color scheme is achromatic with a golden yellow accent color, which sounds quite neutral but since it's what contributes the most to the atmosphere of the website I consider this one of the main design principles of the website.

The colors also contribute to another design principle which is contrast. By pairing the dark background with bright colors and images, the content really "pops", while also improving readability.[^1]

Another prominent design principle is the use of grids. Now, they are not visually explicit since Bew Gorp wants to move away from the rigid feeling of boxes and squares, but grids have still been used to give structure to the creative design and create a sense of hierarchy and balance to the pages, as exemplified by the about page below.

[![Screenshot of my project website's "Bew Gorp" about page, 2021-01-07](%base_url%/image/bewgorp/about_screenshot_210107.png?w=857){.screenshot}](%base_url%/image/bewgorp/about_screenshot_210107.png "Click for full size")

Hierarchy is created by the size of each element and the size of the space it takes. The introductory texts on the first row is more important to give an accurate first impression of Gorp, while the skills are secondary in this sense and are therefore split into smaller parts. The page ends with two large images of Bew Gorp, which were put there to balance the weight of the upper part of the page, including the big "About" heading not shown in the screenshot.

The grid and consequent hierarchy also contributes to the direction of the page, which is another design principle. Having clear hierarchy and thus differentiating between the various content in a certain order helps direct the viewer's eye through the page.

Some other design principles featured in the website include movement, transparency and depth.

### Website Unity

Another design principle that might have caught your eye is the recurring circles used throughout the website. This repetition of shape is used to create a connection between the web pages and contribute to a sense of unity across the website. Not only are they the same shape, but the circles are also all grayscaled, even the project images (before you hover over them), as shown below.

[![Screenshot of my project website's "Bew Gorp" Uber project page, 2021-01-07](%base_url%/image/bewgorp/project_uber_screenshot_210107.png?w=857){.screenshot}](%base_url%/image/bewgorp/project_uber_screenshot_210107.png "Click for full size")

Unity is further strengthened by the common use of typography, color scheme and the balancing feature of grids throughout the website.

Analysis
------------------------

It is no secret that I have been guided by the design principles in creating this website. Without this knowledge I would not have been able to fulfill Bew Gorp's wishes for a creative and innovative but also well-balanced and structured website. 

In other words, I would not have succeeded in giving the website the character that it now has, which would have impeded the message and purpose of the website.

For example, understanding why I needed to increase the size of certain elements to balance the weight of other elements helped me create a website that is aesthetically pleasing and also clear and communicative.

So, by using design principles both as a tool and as a guide, I was able to

1. Design the website to fulfill its purpose;
2. Create website unity and identity, and thus a brand;
3. Improve its communication and thus its accessibility.

Having been able to fulfill these most essential aspects that make up a good website, I can only feel satisfied with my work and hope that Bew Gorp would feel the same.
