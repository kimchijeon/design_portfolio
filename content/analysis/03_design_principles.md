Design Principles Analysis
=======================

This analysis aims to evaluate the use of design principles on three personal websites. The goal is to find which and how design principles are implemented, what feelings this generates and whether it's suitable for the purpose of the website.

Sample
-----------------------

For this analysis I have chosen three personal websites used as examples in the book *The Principles of Beautiful Web Design*[^1]. This is mainly because I am unfamiliar with personal websites and as the only personal websites I've come across are from reading *The Principles of Beautiful Web Design* I decided to start there. 

On top of this, being chosen as an example for this educational book about web design indicates that it is interesting from a web design point of view, which could make for an interesting analysis.

The websites chosen are simply the first ones in the book that are still active. These are [Arnaud Beelen](https://www.arnaudbeelen.be/), [Simon Collison](https://colly.com/) and  [Brian Nathan Hartwell](http://briannathanhartwell.com/).

Method
-----------------------

The evaluation (and thus the method) will be based on the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of the website?
2. What are the main characteristics of the website?
3. Does the design serve the purpose of the website? What feelings does the design create?
4. Which design elements and principles can be identified on the website?
5. Are the design principles implemented equally across the website's different pages?

The main design principles and elements that I will be looking to identify on the websites are based on [Canva's article about "Design elements and Principles"](https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/) by Mary Stribley.

#### Purpose and characteristics
Arnaud Beelen is a graphic designer based in Brussels.

In the navbar you can easily navigate to his "Projects" and "Contact" information. The navbar is very minimalistic so what has been included is the most important content. This indicates that the purpose of the website is to showcase his previous professional work and to get in contact with him for future projects.

The main focus is his projects that you can already see on the homepage. The minimalistic design helps highlight these colorful projects in contrast to the plain white header and grey background color. 

The straightforward design makes interpretation and consumption of the content easy and accessible. Considering the purpose of showcasing his professional work, as well as his aim to "facilitate communication", it makes this design very suitable.

The neatness of the design creates a very professional feeling while each project provides the artistic and creative feeling of Beelen's work.

#### Design element and principles
The main design principles identified on the website are color (contrast and framing), grid, hierarchy and direction.

Color has been used to create contrast to help emphasize the projects. By using background colors other than white, each visual content also seems framed, further highlighting them.

The next obvious feature is the grid layout throughout the website, which makes the website appear very well aligned and neat. 

The grid also helps with the hierarchy of the website where you can see that the header is one column, the projects two and the footer information is split in three. This grid and hierarchy in turn helps with the direction on the website.

Other design principles includes repetition, symmetry and movement.

#### Website unity
The webpages keep the layout of having a big white header of information and then the content below in a grid (although in one column), which ties the webpages to the homepage.

Each project page in turn has a similar layout, tying the webpages themselves together. At the same time, each project has a different background color, giving them their own identity and helps indicate where you are. 

Here there is a balance between keeping the website unified with layout repetition but with enough distinction between the pages as to make communication clear.

### [Simon Collison](https://colly.com/)

#### Purpose and characteristics
Simon Collison is a graphic, digital and product designer from the UK. He is also a writer, conference speaker and event director.

The first content you see is his own timeline, indicating that this website is primarily about getting to know Collison himself. Although the focus is not on his personal timeline but rather the one as a developer, in comparison to Beelen's website Collison's is more personal. This is further supported by him having a personal blog on the website.

In his "About" page he even explicitly writes that he "used to begin with the professional stuff" but now he thinks "the things I love define me better than a list of old clients". Before knowing that this was the idea behind his website, the design already signalled it to me. It's therefore safe to say that the design suits the website's purpose.

The main characteristic of this website is the blue-green color scheme and the toned down white background which creates a down-to-earth and homelike feeling, almost rustic. We truly get an idea of Collison as a person and what he likes.

#### Design element and principles
The most apparent design principles identified on this website are the use of lines, grids and a bit of randomness.

The lines are used to separate the different sections from each other and makes the website look clean and orderly, despite the bit of randomness that the wide variety of images creates.

He lets each visual content retain its identity this way, which could create an incoherent, messy website. However, with the help of not only lines but also grids the website stays well structured and professionally presentable.

Another design principle also found on this website is a good use of hierarchy which creates balance and a clear direction.

#### Website unity
The perfectionist layout repetition that created a clearly unified website for Beelen cannot be found on Collison's website. However, presenting a mishmash of interests that any person would have is the idea behind it.

Although each webpage of Collison's website is presented very differently, the website is held together mainly by the common color scheme, typography and the recurring use of lines as separators. True, it might not be quite as unified as Beelen's website, but I doubt anyone could argue that Collison's website is not well balanced and held together.

### [Brian Nathan Hartwell](http://briannathanhartwell.com/)

#### Purpose and characteristics
Brian Nathan Hartwell is an art director, designer and front-end developer.

Similar to Beelen, the homepage of Hartwell's website is about his professional work. If you click on the menu the "Work" option is first on the list. So the main purpose of this website is to act as a portfolio to showcase his previous work and potentially acquire future work.

The main characteristics of this website are the achromatic color scheme with the golden accent color and the minimalistic layout. I suspect this comes from combining his aims in design ("I'm a fan of structure and simplicity") and his own interests ("I find inspiration in [...] architecture, vintage fashion, [...] science fiction")[^2]. 

It's not as clinical as Beelen's website, but not quite as casual as Collison's. It serves well as a professional portfolio that still gives the user a glimpse of Hartwell's person.

#### Design element and principles
The most striking design principles found on Hartwell's website are the distinct use of color, movement (direction) and typography.

Hartwell has managed to create a brand by the way he has used color and typography. The sans serif typography creates a sleek and clean feeling, while the golden color adds a bit of personality.

The incorporation of movement on this website was quite striking on my first impression. When you enter the website the first page makes a downward motion, giving you a hint to keep moving down which is where you will find his work. This together with the bouncing arrow makes the direction on the website very clear and easy for the user. More movement can be seen from the hover effects over his work showcase. This creates an interactive website which is very intriguing for the user.

Other design principles include grids, transparency, hierarchy, repetition, contrast and texture.

#### Website unity
The subpages don't have the dark colors of the homepage. Instead they have a bright, slightly textured background. This is a clear indication that you are now on a subpage, which also helps emphasize the homepage. 

However, you won't be confused as to whether or not you are still on the same website thanks to the common use of the golden accent color and the distinct typography. Not to mention the logo that stays with you on every page in the upper left corner. The same direction is also used, indicated by the bouncing arrow that you can find on each project page.

Analysis
-----------------------

From analyzing and comparing the three sample websites you can determine which design principles are most commonly used. In this case it's the use of grid and color. Clear hierarchy and direction is also found to be important. 

All three have also done really well on achieving unity across the website by establishing a distinct identity, mostly using color and grid, and sticking to this identity throughout the subpages of the website.

One thing that's also very clear is that the design has been formed after the purpose of the website. The way the website is presented is the way in which the person behind wants to present himself too. In Beelen's case it's the more professional part of himself, while Collison wants to present a more personal side and Hartwell ends up somewhere in between.

My own portfolio
-----------------------
What characterizes my own portfolio is the distinct color scheme and the flash image that acts like kind of a logo for the website. There is also a lot of white space which creates a sense of minimalism. Layout-wise my portfolio is most similar to Collison's by also having a distinct header and footer throughout the website.

Since this is a portfolio in web design I wanted to create a creative-looking website that doesn't look too stiff. At the same time I am a big fan of structure and balance in websites so I didn't want to go too "free-spirit". For the purpose I think the design is suitable to demonstrate my skills in web design as taught by the module so far.

### Design elements and principles
The main design principles found in my portfolio is color and repetition. Grids and lines have also been used to a lesser extent.

The way the color scheme is repeated throughout the portfolio creates an identity and holds it together, even in dark mode, quite similar to the way Hartwell uses color. On every page you also have the same header and flash image. 

The swirly lines in the header also helps create a bit of movement on the website and makes it look a lot less flat than it already is. The navbar is one thick black line to mark the transition from header to main body. My secondary headings are underlined to also mark the transition from one section to another.

Grids have been used for the landing pages of "Analysis" and "Report", but I would love to implement it more throughout the portfolio because I believe this could greatly improve the balance. It could also help me create better hierarchy, as proven by Beelen's website for example. 

I implemented this change on my homepage, which I for a long time felt looked very unbalanced having the image of me below the text. Now I put the elements side by side using a grid and emphasized the structure by adding a line in between, inspired by Collison. The homepage looks better balanced now.

I would also like to incorporate more movement to my portfolio to liven it up and make it feel more interactive, similar to Hartwell's website. The hover effects of screenshots and pictures in my gallery helps with this a bit.
