Website Design Trends Analysis
=======================

This analysis aims to evaluate the current trends in website design by analyzing and comparing three video game console websites to find the most prominent features and which of these are often recurring.

Sample
-----------------------

For this analysis I have chosen three video game console websites: [Playstation](https://www.playstation.com/sv-se/), [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/sv-SE) and [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/). 

The category of websites were chosen not only because of my own personal interest, but mainly because these consoles have a pressure to stay up-to-date as to not harm their image of being the latest and best gaming technology, which is important since they are all competing with each other for the same customers. 

As websites are part of the marketing online, these companies thus have a big incentive to keep their websites current and captivating. For an analysis that will look into current website design trends, these websites are therefore very suitable.

The reason why the particular video game consoles were chosen is because they are currently the biggest and most popular ones on the market.

Method
-----------------------

To evaluate the trends I will first identify the most prominent features of each website and compare them with each other. If there are any features that appear in multiple websites, one could call this a trend.

To further establish the trends found in the websites of this analysis, I will compare them to previous observations. For this I have used *The Principles of Beautiful Web Design*'s chapter about "Layout and Composition" where there is a subsection called "Fresh Trends".[^1] These are in short:

- Full Screen Backgrounds
- Flat Design
- Video Backgrounds
- Masonry Layout
- Parallax

By comparing the trends found in this analysis and the trends from previous observations, I can determine whether or not the trends found are general or not.

Results
-----------------------

### [Playstation](https://www.playstation.com/sv-se/)

#### Most prominent features
When you enter Playstation's website you are met with a huge slideshow header of the latest content that almost covers the whole of above the fold. The slideshow's automatic rotating creates a sense of movement on the page and the hovering effects of various links makes the page feel very interactive.

The navigation bar is located above the hero header and sticks with you as you progress down the page.

As you keep scrolling down a page the different content is divided into sections that fill the entire page. Each section is separated from the others by having a different colored or image background. Despite this the website still has a minimalistic feel to it by keeping the negative space and the background simple and flat.

Each page might technically be quite long but this way you are scrolling through a showcase of content instead of having to click your way to it. By covering its content over the entire page it differs from more traditional website design where the main body of content is located towards the middle of the page.

Grids can often be seen, for example when showcasing different games, but each section has their own layout depending on the content. The great variation of layout, images and colors is prominent and makes the website very captivating and exciting.

### [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/sv-SE)
[![Screenshot of Xbox's homepage, 2021-01-06](%base_url%/image/xbox_screenshot_210106.png?w=857){.screenshot}](%base_url%/image/xbox_screenshot_210106.png? "Click for full size")

#### Most prominent features
Similar to Playstation, you are met with a giant slideshow hero header on Xbox's home page which captivates you with its images and movement. This is also the fastest way to give you a lot of content in a short time.

Xbox's navigation bar is also located above the header, but doesn't have the sticky function.

Grids are more prominent on Xbox's website than Playstation, probably since it is part of its brand and console design. As you scroll down the home page you are met with a grid that introduces you to a variety of content. Here there is also a lot of movement when the grids shifts upwards as you scroll down. The grids keep recurring in the other pages as well.

The grids together with a good balance between images and flat spaces/backgrounds also creates a contemporary and slightly minimalistic feel.

Each web page is designed quite similar to Playstation's web pages where the content is all laid out vertically in sections for you to scroll down. In Xbox's case the sections are usually made up of a grid with different sizes of squares as opposed to Playstation's rows of content. Again, there is a great variation in layout and images.

### [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/)
[![Screenshot of Nintendo's homepage, 2021-01-06](%base_url%/image/nintendo_screenshot_210106.png?w=857){.screenshot}](%base_url%/image/nintendo_screenshot_210106.png? "Click for full size")

#### Most prominent features
Like the two previous websites, Nintendo also has a large hero header to greet you on their home page to quickly capture your attention. At the point of writing the home page 
header is not a slideshow. 

However, on [the Nintendo Switch page](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/) there is a rotating slideshow, meaning it is not completely absent from the website. So, there is also a significant amount of movement on Nintendo's website like the previous websites, for example in the toggling navbar and thumbnails popping up the first time you load the website.

Similar to the previous websites, the navigation bar is kept on top of the page above the header. The main navbar is not sticky, but the pages that have their own navbar have a sticky one.

The way that Nintendo presents the rest of its content differs slightly from Playstation and Xbox in the way that there is a lot more white space. This is because Nintendo leans more towards a traditional website layout by having its main content located in the middle, giving it a more blog-like feeling. For example, each section is divided by a line instead of filling the entire width of the page.

Despite this, the use of grids and the wide variety of images are still prominent throughout the website, just like the two previous websites.

Analysis
-----------------------------------
With a quick look at all of these websites you can tell that they are quite similar in design. This of course has to do with the fact that they are the same category of websites and thus have similar purposes which in turn affect the design of the website.

One trend you can quickly establish is the use of a large hero header on the home page to quickly capture the viewer's attention and interest. The use of this is not unlike the "full screen background" trend mentioned in *The Principles of Beautiful Web Design*, which is about "inducing the wow factor".[^2] The "full screen background" trend also explains why Playstation and Xbox have presented their content in page-filling sections with loads of images and colors. 

However, this is balanced with a flat, almost minimalistic design by confining the images and texture within certain areas and mixing these with simple, single-colored white spaces or backgrounds. Nintendo also keeps their background color a simple white, instead of for example having a background image or texture. This differs from previous trends where "web design has been about depth, adding gradients and rounded shadows to give a website a dimensional look".[^3] 

Another trend you can identify is the explicit use of grids where you find content ordered in squares with great balance. This is especially noticeable in Xbox's case but also on [the Nintendo Switch page](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/). This reminds me of the trend Beaird and George calls "masonry layout" which "makes content stack vertically to fit in the best way possible" and where "images and text fit veritcally and horizontally to fill the browser".[^4]

Other smaller trends you can see in all three websites are the location of the navbar above the huge header area and the incorporation of movement into the website.

### Conclusion

All in all, the three websites are quite similar in their most prominent features. Nintendo differs the most from the three of them by leaning more towards a traditional blog-like layout, while Playstation and Xbox have broken out of confining the main content in a middle section. 

The general feeling created by these websites are however the same. This is due to the common use of trends such as the huge hero header, the simplistic and flat white spaces and backgrounds, grids and movement features.

The features found in the three sample websites can be connected to a few of the "fresh trends" as described by Beaird and George, including "full screen background, "flat design" and "masonry layout". This indicates that they are to a certain extent part of the general website design trends that we can see today.
